/*
Pattern 1 :

        * * * *
        * * *
        * * 
        * 
        
here aldo  we want to move across row and move along coloumn and print *

here we use i for move across row. and j for move and print *

now we can make relation  between i and j 
    row number(i)       number of * (j)
        1                   4
        2                   3
        3                   2
        4                   1

    and go on
    here we can adapt a easy way , here we can just reverse the conditions in the pattern1.c
